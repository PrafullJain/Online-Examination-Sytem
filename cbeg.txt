\tQUESTIONS\t	\tR1\t	\tR2\t	\tR3\t	\tR4\t	\tMARKS\t	\tSNO\t	\tCANSWER\t	\tUANSWER\t	\tEXPLANATION\t
\tAn array elements are always stored in which memory locations?\t	\tSequential\t	\tRandom\t	\tSequential & Random\t	\tNone of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t1\t	\tSequential\t	\tSequential & Random\t	\tBecause,In c array is always allocate contiguous memory allocation assigns the consecutive blocks of memory to a process\t
\tWhat is C tokens?\t	\tSmallest individual units of C program\t	\tThe basic element recognized by compiler\t	\tThe largest individual units of program\t	\tBoth (1) & (2)\t	\t5.0\t	\t2\t	\tBoth(1)&(2)\t	\tThe basic element recognized by compiler\t	\tActually C tokens are the basic buildings blocks in C language which are constructed together to write a C program.\t
\tWhich of the following is not true about Pre-processor Directive?\t	\tBegin with Hash symbol\t	\tProcessed by Pre-processor\t	\tForm an integral part of the code\t	\tEnd with a semi-colon\t	\t5.0\t	\t3\t	\tEnd with a semi-colon\t	\tForm an integral part of the code\t	\tBecause Pre-Processor directive is a linking library that is begin with hash(#) symbol like #include<conio.h>.\t
\tEach pass through a loop is called a/an?\t	\tEnumeration\t	\tIteration\t	\tCulmination\t	\tPass through\t	\t5.0\t	\t4\t	\tIteration\t	\tEnumeration\t	\tBecause array is type of an iteration process in for/while/do-while loop to iterate same data type value.\t
\tThe Keyword Typedef is used to?\t	\tCreate a type of function\t	\tDefine the type of function\t	\tDefine the type of variable\t	\tCreate a datatype name\t	\t5.0\t	\t5\t	\tCreate a datatype name\t	\tDefine the type of variable\t	\tBecause Typedef is a keyword that is that used to make Same datatype name as you seen in Structue of C.\t
\tFor 16-bit compiler allowable range for integer constant is?\t	\t-3.43809000 - -3.638090090\t	\t32767-32768\t	\t32768-32767\t	\t32668-32667\t	\t5.0\t	\t6\t	\t32768-32767\t	\t32767-32768\t	\tIn a 16 Bit C compiler we have 2 bytes to store an integer, and 1 byte for a character. For unsigned integers the range is 0 to 65535. For signed integers the range is -32768-32767.\t
\tWhat does the unary & operator means in C?\t	\tVariable address\t	\tVariable right value\t	\tVariable binary form\t	\tVariable value\t	\t5.0\t	\t7\t	\tVariable address\t	\tVariable binary form\t	\tBecause generally unary/address-of operator is used in pointer to pass the value as address in Formal arguments.\t
\tC programs are converted into machine language with help of?\t	\tAn Editor\t	\tA Compiler\t	\tAn Operating System\t	\tNone of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t8\t	\tA Compiler\t	\tAn Operating System\t	\tBecause Compiler takes the program code (source code) and converts the source code or to a machine language module (called an object file).\t
\tWhich of the following is allowed in a C Arithmetic instruction?\t	\t[]\t	\t{}\t	\t()\t	\tNone of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t10\t	\t()\t	\t[]\t	\tC arithmetic instruction consists of a variable name on the left hand side of = and variable names & constants on the right hand side of =.
The variables and constants appearing on the right hand side of = that are connected\t
\tWhich library function can convert an integer/long to a string?\t	\tltoa()\t	\tultoa()\t	\tsprintf()\t	\tNone of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t9\t	\tltoa()\t	\tultoa()\t	\tBecause itoa takes the integer input value input and converts it to a number in base radix. The resulting number (a sequence of base-radix digits) is written to the output buffer buffer.\t
