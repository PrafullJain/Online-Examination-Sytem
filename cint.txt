\tWhat is right way to access a structure variable book[price,page]?\t	\tprintf("%d%d",book.price,book.page)\t	\tprintf("%d%d",price.book,page.book)\t	\tprintf("%d%d"<price.book,<page.book)\t	\tprintf("%d%d",price>book,page>book)\t	\t5.0\t	\t1\t	\tprintf("%d%d",book.price,book.page)\t	\tprintf("%d%d",price.book,page.book)\t	\tBecause it is pre-defined syntax of structure in c\t
\tA continue statement cause execution to skip to?\t	\tReturn 0;statement\t	\tFirst statement after the loop\t	\tStatement follow the continue statement\t	\tNext iteration of loop\t	\t5.0\t	\t2\t	\tStatement follow the continue statement\t	\tFirst statement after the loop\t	\tBecause continue keyword is only work to skip the statement that is mostly used in switch-case statement.\t
\tWhich of the following is not recommended in Header file of C?\t	\tType definitions\t	\tClass definitions\t	\tFunction definitions\t	\tTemplate definitions\t	\t5.0\t	\t3\t	\tTemplate definitions\t	\tFunction definitions\t	\tActually Template definition is not provided in C language because this defintions is used to change the data type without or to perform different tyoe of operation like Searching,Sorting etc.,It is mostly used in Oops Programming language like C++ & Java.\t
\tA name having a few letters,numbers & special character_(underscore) is called?\t	\tKeywords\t	\tReserved keywords\t	\ttokens\t	\tIdentifiers\t	\t5.0\t	\t4\t	\tIdentifiers\t	\tReserved keywords\t	\tThere is no explanation for this question\t
\tGiven two literals 0x001B & 033.What are these equals to?\t	\t21 & 33\t	\t27 & 33\t	\t33 & 33\t	\t27 & 27\t	\t5.0\t	\t5\t	\t27 & 27\t	\t33 & 33\t	\tThere is no explanation for this question\t
\t= & == have the same operation?\t	\t=check the data type & == check the both left,right value\t	\t= assign a right value & == assign a left value\t	\t= assign a right value & == check the value is same or not\t	\tNone of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t6\t	\t= assign a right value & == check the value is same or not\t	\t= assign a right value & == assign a left value\t	\tThere is no explanation for this question\t
\tRight shifting an operand 1-bit is equivalent to multiplying it by 2?\t	\tTrue\t	\tFalse\t	\t\t	\t\t	\t5.0\t	\t7\t	\tFalse\t	\tFalse\t	\tThere is no explanation for this question\t
\tAn external variable is one?\t	\tWhich resides int the memory till the end of program\t	\tWhich is globally access by all functions\t	\tWhich is declared outside the body of any function\t	\tAll of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t8\t	\tAll of the above\t	\tWhich is globally access by all functions\t	\tBecause external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside of any function; this sets aside storage for it. The variable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it; this states the type of the variable. The declaration may be an explicit extern statement or may be implicit from context.\t
\tBitwise operator can operate on?\t	\tDouble & Chars\t	\tFloats & Doubles \t	\tInts & Floats\t	\tInts & Chars\t	\t5.0\t	\t9\t	\tInts & Chars\t	\tInts & Floats\t	\tThere is no explanation for this question\t
\tChoose the option that contains only Unary operator of C?\t	\tSizeof,(type conversion)\t	\tShorthand operator,&\t	\t++,>=,!\t	\t==,!=\t	\t5.0\t	\t10\t	\tSizeof,(type conversion)\t	\tShorthand operator,&\t	\tThere is no explanation for this question\t
