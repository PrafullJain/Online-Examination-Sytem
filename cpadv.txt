\tWhich of the following statement is correct?\t	\tReference is declared using * operator\t	\tVariable can have multiple reference\t	\tReference must always be initialized within classes\t	\tNone of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t1\t	\tVariable can have multiple reference\t	\tVariable can have multiple reference\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tWhich of the following statement is not correct?\t	\tDefault value for an argument can be a global constant\t	\tDefault arguments are given in the function prototype\t	\tCompiler uses the prototype information to build a call\t	\tDefault argument given in the function prototype & should be repeated in the function definition\t	\t5.0\t	\t2\t	\tDefault argument given in the function prototype & should be repeated in the function definition\t	\tDefault argument given in the function prototype & should be repeated in the function definition\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tWhich of the following statement is correct?\t	\tAn array of reference is acceptable\t	\tAn array of reference is not acceptable\t	\tReference is like a structure\t	\tNone of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t3\t	\tAn array of reference is not acceptable\t	\tAn array of reference is not acceptable\t	\tBecause in array reference variable that point to any address of variable.So it only contain the address not the value of variable.\t
\tWhich of the following statement is correct with respect of friend keyword inside a class?\t	\tPrivate data member can be declared as a friend\t	\tClass may be declared as friend\t	\tObject is declared as friend\t	\tFriend use as class name\t	\t5.0\t	\t4\t	\tClass may be declared as friend\t	\tClass may be declared as friend\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tDestructor has same name as the constructor & it is preceded by?\t	\t!\t	\t~\t	\t?\t	\t$\t	\t5.0\t	\t5\t	\t~\t	\t~\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question,But it is syntax of destructor.\t
\tWhich of the following type of class allow only one object of it to be created?\t	\tVirtual class\t	\tAbstract class\t	\tSingleton class\t	\tFriend class\t	\t5.0\t	\t6\t	\tSingleton class\t	\tSingleton class\t	\tIn object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time. After first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable also points to the first instance created.\t
\tHow many instances of an abstract class can be created?\t	\t1\t	\t5\t	\t13\t	\t0\t	\t5.0\t	\t7\t	\t0\t	\t0\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tWhen Global objects is destroyed?\t	\tControl comes out of block in which they used\t	\tProgram terminates\t	\tControl comes out of function in which they used\t	\tAs soon as local objects die\t	\t5.0\t	\t8\t	\tProgram terminates\t	\tAs soon as local objects die\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
