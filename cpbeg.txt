\tQUESTIONS\t	\tR1\t	\tR2\t	\tR3\t	\tR4\t	\tMARKS\t	\tSNO\t	\tCANSWER\t	\tUANSWER\t	\tEXPLANATION\t
\tWhich of the following statement is correct?\t	\tA reference is a constant pointer\t	\tA reference is not a constant pointer\t	\tAn array of reference is acceptable \t	\tIt is possible to create a reference of reference\t	\t5.0\t	\t1\t	\tA reference is a constant pointer\t	\tAn array of reference is acceptable\t	\tBecause,reference/address-of & operator is used to point a particular value address and if you instantiate with any value than it is not able to point another value address.\t
\tWhich of the following statement is correct?\t	\tData items in class must be private\t	\tBoth data & function can be either private or public\t	\tMember function of class must be private\t	\tConstructor of class cannot be private\t	\t5.0\t	\t2\t	\tBoth data & function can be either private or public\t	\tMember function of class must be private\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question\t
\tWhich of the following means "Use of one class in definition of another class"?\t	\tEncapsulation\t	\tInheritance\t	\tComposition\t	\tAbstraction\t	\t5.0\t	\t3\t	\tInheritance\t	\tComposition\t	\tBecause according to Oops concept Inheritance is performed in parent-child/super-base class like our mobile-phone to smart-phone generation that provide all the features of mobile phones with extra features like face-recognization/fingerprint sensor.\t
\tHow many default constructor per class are possible?\t	\tOnly one\t	\tTwo\t	\tThree\t	\tInfinite\t	\t5.0\t	\t4\t	\tOnly one\t	\tThree\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question\t
\tWhich of the header file include definition of cin & cout?\t	\tistream.h\t	\tostream.h\t	\tiomanip.h\t	\tiostream.h\t	\t5.0\t	\t5\t	\tiostream.h\t	\tiomanip.h\t	\tBecause cin & cout means console input/output that is only applicable in C++,when we add Strem header file iostream.h.\t
\tWhich of the following provides reuse mechanism?\t	\tAbstraction\t	\tInheritance\t	\tPolymorphism\t	\tEncapsulation\t	\t5.0\t	\t6\t	\tInheritance\t	\tAbstraction\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question\t
\tWhich of the following can not have the default parameters?\t	\tMember function of class\t	\tmain()\t	\tMember function of structure\t	\tBoth (2) & (3)\t	\t5.0\t	\t7\t	\tmain()\t	\tBoth (2) & (3)\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question\t
\tWhich of the following is known as Instance of class?\t	\tFriend function\t	\tObject\t	\tMember function\t	\tMember variable\t	\t5.0\t	\t8\t	\tObject\t	\tMember function\t	\tBecause object is an entity that belongs to real world objects.So it is instance of class.Instance is nothing but object of class like fruit is name in which all different types of fruit will included.\t
\tConstructor is executed when?\t	\tObject is created\t	\tObject is used\t	\tA Class is declared\t	\tObject goes out of scope\t	\t5.0\t	\t9\t	\tObject is created\t	\tObject goes out of scope\t	\tBecause,Constructor is special member function of class that is mostly used to provide default values to variable like initializing static variable.\t
\tWhich of the following statement is correct?\t	\tClass is an instance of object\t	\tObject is an instance of class\t	\tClass is an instance of datatype\t	\tObject is an instance of datatype\t	\t5.0\t	\t10\t	\tObject is an instance of class\t	\tObject is an instance of class\t	\tThis question answer is also mentioned in question 8.\t
