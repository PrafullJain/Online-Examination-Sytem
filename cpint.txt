\tWhich of the statement is correct about destructor?\t	\tDestructor has void return type\t	\tDestructor has integer return type\t	\tDestructor has no return type\t	\tNone of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t1\t	\tDestructor has no return type\t	\tNone of the above\t	\tBecause,Destructor is special member function of class that automatically executed when instance of class is goes out of class.\t
\tWhich of the following function cannot be overloaded?\t	\tMember function\t	\tStatic function\t	\tVirtual function\t	\tBoth (2) & (3)\t	\t5.0\t	\t2\t	\tVirtual function\t	\tStatic function\t	\tBecause virtual function a member function which is declared within base class and is re-defined (Overriden) by derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classes version of the function.It is important for runtime-polymorphism.\t
\tWhich of the following Keyword is used to overload an operator?\t	\toverload\t	\toperator\t	\tfriend\t	\toverride\t	\t5.0\t	\t3\t	\toperator\t	\tfriend\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tWhich of the following is not a type of Inheritance?\t	\tMultiple\t	\tMutlilevel\t	\tDistributive\t	\tHierarchical\t	\t5.0\t	\t4\t	\tDistributive\t	\tMultilevel\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tWhich of the following is the mechanism of static polymorphism?\t	\tOperator overloading\t	\tFunction overloading\t	\tTemplates\t	\tAll of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t5\t	\tAll of the above\t	\tAll of the above\t	\tBecause runtime-polymorphism requires inheritance,function overriding & use of abstract function.\t
\tWhat type of error occurs,when arguments is passed to destructor?\t	\tLogical\t	\tVirtual\t	\tSyntax\t	\tLinker\t	\t5.0\t	\t6\t	\tSyntax\t	\tSyntax\t	\tBecause,Destructor has no return type or it also does not return any value.\t
\tWhich of the following two entities can be connected by dot operator?\t	\tClass member & Class object\t	\tClass object & Class\t	\tClass & Member of that class\t	\tClass object& Member of that class\t	\t5.0\t	\t7\t	\tClass object& Member of that class\t	\tClass object & Class\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tHow "Late Binding" is implemented in C++?\t	\tUsing C++ tables\t	\tUsing Virtual tables\t	\tUsing Indexed virtual tables\t	\tUsing Polymorphic tables\t	\t5.0\t	\t8\t	\tUsing Virtual tables\t	\tUsing Virtual tables\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tWhich of the following statement is correct?\t	\tOverloaded function accept the same number of arguments\t	\tOverloaded function always return the value of same data type \t	\tOverloaded function accept only same number & same type of argument\t	\tOverloaded function accept only different number & different type of argument\t	\t5.0\t	\t9\t	\tOverloaded function accept the same number of arguments\t	\tOverloaded function always return the value of same data type\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
\tWhy reference is not same as pointer?\t	\tIt can never be null\t	\tIf it once established cannot be changed\t	\tIt does not need an explicit dereferencing mechanism\t	\tAll of the above\t	\t5.0\t	\t10\t	\tAll of the above\t	\tIt does not need an explicit dereferencing mechanism\t	\tThere is no explanation for these question.\t
